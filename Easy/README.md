## Two Sum (C#)

This was my first solution on LeetCode, it was a strong start to my journey. Once I developed a solution through utilising my knoweldge of nested loops, I discovered the importance of efficiency when curating algorithms, with a core focus on time & space complexity, something I only covered at surface level in my studies. Such factors will be taken into consideration with future problems I encounter.
