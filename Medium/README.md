## Add Two Numbers (C#)

This problem introduced me to linked lists, I defaulted to using an array, resulting in an algorithm of high time complexity & wasted computational time. Once guided towards linked lists, I researched their concept and implementation, allowing me to develop an algorithm of suitable efficiency.

## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (C#)

My intial approach to this problem was insufficient, the algorithm brute-forced all substrings until the longest one was found. I encountered hashsets for the first time when seeking more efficient solutions, learning how to create and manipulate them, forming an algorithm of suitable time & space complexity.
